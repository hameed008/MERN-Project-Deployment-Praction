Good catch! In that structure, the `package.json` is **outside** to treat the whole project (`mern-app/`) as a **monorepo**â€”a single root folder managing **both frontend and backend**.

---

### But in practice:

âœ… **Common structure** is:

```
mern-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json  âœ… backend deps (Express, Mongoose)
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json  âœ… frontend deps (React, Vite)
```

Each side manages its own dependencies and can be deployed separately (like on Render for backend and Vercel for frontend).

---

### So, why use one root `package.json`?

ðŸ‘‰ Only if you're using tools like **Lerna**, **Yarn workspaces**, or **Turborepo** to manage both parts together (less common for beginners).

---

### ðŸ”¥ Recommendation for you:

Keep separate `package.json` files inside both:

- `backend/`
- `frontend/`

This keeps things clean, and each part can run, test, and deploy independently.
